    Risk of trading futures and options The risk of loss in trading futures contracts or options is substantial. In some circumstances, you may sustain losses in excess of your initial margin funds. Placing contingent orders, such as stop-loss or stop-limit orders, will not necessarily avoid loss. Market conditions may make it impossible to execute such orders. You may be called upon at short notice to deposit additional margin funds. If the required funds are not provided within the prescribed time, your position may be liquidated. You will remain liable for any resulting deficit in your account. You should therefore study and understand futures contracts and options before you trade and carefully consider whether such trading is suitable in the light of your own financial position and investment objectives. If you trade options you should inform yourself of exercise and expiration procedures and your rights and obligations upon exercise or expiry. PLEASE READ VERY CAREFULLY THE WHOLE OF THIS DOCUMENT BEFORE YOU SIGN ON THE CLIENT AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE IN DOUBT ABOUT THIS DOCUMENT, YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR LAWYER OR OTHER PROFESSIONAL ADVISER.
